- It seems that the program spends most of its time conducting the bubble sort (Bottle neck).

- When profiling the program on 30000, the bubble sort took 5.85 seconds cumulatively and 2.38 seconds on itself.

- One of its function calls took nearly 30% of the execution time.

- Per call, the bubble sort costs us 9.39 seconds in total.



- This bubble sort takes so much time because it has to call the vector-accessor-operator 1348228538 times, an excessive amount of times.

- The bubble sort is also slowed down by the LESS_THAN value-comparison and SWAP-operation.

- Note, these operations are vector-based.

- Perhaps C++ vectors are an expensive strucute and the bubble_sort could be impleneted more efficiently with a different structure.
